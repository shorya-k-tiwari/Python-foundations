# Computational Physics

This section applies Python to simulate and compute real physical systems.

The objective is simple:
Turn physics formulas into working, testable programs.

This folder exists to:
- Bridge theory and computation
- Build intuition for motion, forces, and systems
- Prepare for advanced simulations and AI-based modeling

Key principles:
- Physics first, code second
- Units, constants, and assumptions must be explicit
- No magic numbers, no blind copying

Examples include:
- Projectile motion
- Time of flight
- Range calculations
- Kinematic equations
- Future: numerical simulations and visualizations

If mathematics is the blade,
computational physics is learning how to swing it.

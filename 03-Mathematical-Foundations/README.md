# Mathematical Foundations

This section builds the mathematical backbone required for serious
programming, algorithms, physics simulations, and machine learning.

The goal here is NOT speed.
The goal is absolute clarity and control over mathematical logic.

Every program in this folder:
- Translates mathematics into executable logic
- Strengthens symbolic thinking
- Removes fear of formulas, equations, and abstractions

Topics include (but are not limited to):
- Linear equations
- Quadratic equations
- Algebraic manipulation
- Mathematical functions
- Numerical reasoning

These programs are tools.
Mathematics is not memorized here — it is weaponized.
